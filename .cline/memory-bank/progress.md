# Progress: mimium-rs

## What Works

1. **Core Language Implementation**:
   - Lexer and parser using chumsky
   - Type checker with Hindley-Milner type inference
   - MIR generation
   - Bytecode generation
   - Virtual machine for execution

2. **Audio Processing**:
   - Real-time audio output
   - Multiple audio backends
   - Sample-by-sample processing

3. **Language Features**:
   - Functional programming model
   - First-class functions and closures
   - Pattern matching
   - Signal feedback with `self`
   - Scheduling with the `@` operator

4. **Development Tools**:
   - Command-line interface
   - REPL for interactive development
   - Basic LSP server structure
   - Document management in LSP
   - Syntax error reporting in LSP

## What's Left to Build

1. **LSP Features**:
   - Complete hover information implementation
   - Enhance code completion with context awareness
   - Add go to definition functionality
   - Add find references functionality
   - Add document symbols functionality
   - Integration testing with various editors

2. **Language Enhancements**:
   - Improved error messages
   - More comprehensive standard library
   - Better documentation and examples

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Optimize bytecode generation
   - Improve VM performance
   - Reduce memory usage

4. **Integration**:
   - VSCode extension for mimium
   - Integration with other audio tools and DAWs

## Current Status

The project is in active development with a focus on implementing the Language Server Protocol (LSP) server. The core language implementation is stable and functional, and the LSP server has basic functionality for syntax error reporting, hover information, and code completion.

The next phase of development will focus on enhancing the LSP server with more advanced features and improving the overall developer experience.

## Known Issues

1. **LSP Implementation**:
   - Hover information is currently a placeholder
   - Code completion is limited to basic keywords and functions
   - Error location information could be improved

2. **Performance**:
   - Some operations may be slower than optimal
   - Memory usage could be optimized

3. **Documentation**:
   - More comprehensive documentation is needed
   - More examples would be helpful

## Evolution of Project Decisions

1. **Language Design**:
   - Started with a simple functional language
   - Added unique features like `self` and `@` for audio programming
   - Evolved to support more complex audio processing patterns

2. **Implementation**:
   - Initially focused on core language features
   - Added audio processing capabilities
   - Now expanding to developer tools like the LSP server

3. **Tooling**:
   - Started with a basic command-line interface
   - Added REPL for interactive development
   - Now implementing LSP for IDE integration

4. **Community**:
   - Building a community around mimium
   - Gathering feedback to improve the language
   - Planning for wider adoption
