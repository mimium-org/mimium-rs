a programming language as an infrastructure for sound and music

---

mimium(MInimal-Musical-medIUM) is a programming language for sound and music.

mimium is made to be an infrastructure for distributing music in a form of a source code, not only a tool for musicians and programmers.

Its semantics are technically inspired from several modern programming languages for sound such as *[Faust](https://faust.grame.fr)* and *[Extempore](https://extemporelang.github.io/)*.. 

A minimal example below generates a sinewave of 440Hz.

```rust
// minimal.mmm
let twopi = 3.141595*2
let sr = 48000
fn dsp(){
  sin(now * 440 * twopi / sr)
}
```
*This repository is a mimium Version 2, all the code base is rewritten in Rust while the original was in C++, and Semantics of the language was re-designed. The code is still very under development.*

## Overview of the new compiler-pipeline

- Source code -> tokenizer -> parser -> AST â†“
- Removing "self" -> Type Inference & SSA Conversion -> MIR(Imperative)
- VM ByteCode Generation
