# Active Context: mimium-rs

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on implementing a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server for the mimium programming language. This will provide IDE features such as syntax error reporting, code completion, and hover information to improve the developer experience.

## Recent Changes

1. **Created mimium-lsp Crate**: Added a new crate to the workspace for the LSP implementation
2. **Basic LSP Server Structure**: Implemented the core server structure using the tower-lsp crate
3. **Document Management**: Added functionality to track open documents and their content
4. **Diagnostics Capability**: Implemented syntax error reporting using the existing parser
5. **Hover Capability**: Added placeholder implementation for hover information
6. **Completion Capability**: Added basic code completion for keywords and functions

## Next Steps

1. **Improve Diagnostics**: Enhance error reporting with better location information
2. **Implement Hover**: Complete the hover functionality to show type information
3. **Enhance Completion**: Add context-aware completion suggestions
4. **Add Go to Definition**: Implement navigation to symbol definitions
5. **Add Find References**: Implement finding all references to a symbol
6. **Add Document Symbols**: Implement listing all symbols in a document
7. **Integration Testing**: Test the LSP server with various editors

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **LSP Implementation Approach**: Using tower-lsp for the LSP server implementation due to its robust support for the LSP protocol and integration with Tokio for async operations.
2. **Document Management**: Using DashMap for concurrent document storage to handle multiple documents efficiently.
3. **Error Reporting**: Leveraging the existing error reporting system in mimium-lang to provide detailed diagnostics.
4. **Modular Design**: Organizing capabilities in separate modules for better maintainability and extensibility.
5. **Performance Considerations**: Balancing responsiveness with accuracy for real-time feedback.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Async/Await**: Using Tokio's async/await for non-blocking operations in the LSP server.
2. **Error Handling**: Using anyhow for error handling in the LSP server.
3. **Concurrency**: Using DashMap for concurrent access to documents.
4. **Code Organization**: Separating capabilities into modules for better maintainability.
5. **Documentation**: Providing comprehensive documentation for the LSP server.

## Learnings and Project Insights

1. **Language Server Protocol**: The LSP provides a standardized way for editors to communicate with language servers, enabling rich IDE features.
2. **Tower-LSP**: The tower-lsp crate provides a high-level abstraction for implementing LSP servers in Rust.
3. **Mimium Language Structure**: The mimium language has a well-defined structure that can be leveraged for IDE features.
4. **Error Reporting**: The existing error reporting system in mimium-lang can be adapted for LSP diagnostics.
5. **Type Information**: The type inference system can be used to provide hover information.
